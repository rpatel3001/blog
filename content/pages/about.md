Title: About Me
Status: published


Hi, I'm Rajan. I've recently graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I'm a big fan of embedded systems and the mix of hardware and software design. I currently work at a large defense contractor doing FPGA design for electronic warfare systems. 

My other main interest is reading, both fiction and nonfiction. I especially enjoy fantasy series with strong worldbuilding and historical accounts of important people and advances in engineering. I'm also currently following several web serials in addition to reading traditionally published books.
