Title: About Me
Status: published


Hi, I'm Rajan. I've recently graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I'm a big fan of embedded systems and the mix of hardware and software design. I am currently on my last summer vacation ever before permanently becoming a working adult. After that, I will be doing digital design for FPGAs in radar systems for a large defense contractor. 

My other main interest is reading, both fiction and nonfiction. I have especially enjoyed biographies and historical accounts of important people and advances in engineering. I'm currently keeping track of several web serials in addition to reading published books. Suggestions are welcome over at [my reading list]({filename}/reading/list.md).
