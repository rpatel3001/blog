Title: About Me
Status: published


Hi, I'm Rajan. Right now, I'm a senior at Rutgers University studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. I'm a big fan of embedded systems and the mix of hardware and software design. I am currently working almost full-time at a contract design and manufacturing firm working with PLC based systems and embedded Linux devices. After graduation I will be working at a defense contractor on FPGA based systems. 

My other main interest is reading, both fiction and nonfiction. I have especially enjoyed biographies and historical accounts of important people and advances in engineering. I'm currently working my way through the excellent  Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan (and later Brandon Sanderson). Suggestions are welcome over at [my reading list]({filename}/reading/list.md).
