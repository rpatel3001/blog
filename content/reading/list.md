Note: The descriptions have been taken from the source material where possible, otherwise I've written one up myself. 

| Title | Author | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Gods are Bastards | D. D. Webb | In Progress | Evil is rising.  The world is rent by strife.  The gods have turned away from us.  In times past, heroes of sword and sorcery have always risen to turn back the tide of darkness…  But what will become of us all, now that swords are obsolete, sorcery is industrialized, and heroism itself is considered a relic of the past? |
| A Practical Guide to Evil | Erraticerrata | In Progress | For twenty years the Dread Empress has ruled over the lands that were once the Kingdom of Callow, but behind the scenes of this dawning golden age threats to the crown are rising. The nobles of the Wasteland, denied the power they crave, weave their plots behind pleasant smiles. In the north the Forever King eyes the ever-expanding borders of the Empire and ponders war. The greatest danger lies to the west, where the First Prince of Procer has finally claimed her throne: her people sundered, she wonders if a crusade might not be the way to secure her reign. Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of the conquered lands the most dangerous man alive sat across an orphan girl and offered her a knife. |
| Pokemon: The Origin of Species | Daystar Eld | In Progress | Enter the world of Pokémon from a rational perspective. Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from. |
| Mother of Learning | nobody103 | In Progress | Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog Day' style setup in a fantasy world. |
| Vacant Throne | TowerCurator | In Progress | Alyssa Meadows, a worker at a local home improvement store, returns home one evening to her home invaded by burglars. A bad night gets worse when, after accidentally killing one, an angel appears before her and tells her she is destined to die. Alyssa takes exception to that and saves herself, only to find out that angels don’t like destiny being messed with. She finds herself shunted off to an alternate world filled with magic and monsters to preserve Earth’s future. |
| The Horrendous Imaginings | Joseph Daniel | In Progress | Despite his subpar wishgranting abilities, Judah is embroiled in mystery and adventure. |
| Worth the Candle | cthulhuraejepsen | In Progress | From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth. |
| Ward | Wildbow | In Progress | (Sequel to Worm) The unwritten rules that govern the fights and outright wars between ‘capes’ have been amended: everyone gets their second chance.  It’s an uneasy thing to come to terms with when notorious supervillains and even monsters are playing at being hero.  The world ended two years ago, and as humanity straddles the old world and the new, there aren’t records, witnesses, or facilities to answer the villains’ past actions in the present.  One of many compromises, uneasy truces and deceptions that are starting to splinter as humanity rebuilds. |
| Twig | Wildbow | Complete | The year is 1921, and a little over a century has passed since a great mind unraveled the underpinnings of life itself.  Every week, it seems, the papers announce great advances, solving the riddle of immortality, successfully reviving the dead, the cloning of living beings, or blending of two animals into one.  For those on the ground, every week brings new mutterings of work taken by ‘stitched’ men of patchwork flesh that do not need to sleep, or more fearful glances as they have to step off the sidewalks to make room for great laboratory-grown beasts.  Often felt but rarely voiced is the notion that events are already spiraling out of the control of the academies that teach these things. |
| Pact | Wildbow | Complete | Blake Thorburn was driven away from home and family by a vicious fight over inheritance, returning only for a deathbed visit with the grandmother who set it in motion.   Blake soon finds himself next in line to inherit the property, a trove of dark supernatural knowledge, and the many enemies his grandmother left behind her in the small town of Jacob’s Bell. |
| The Wheel of Time | Robert Jordan | Complete | The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. |
| The Metropolitan Man | alexanderwales | Complete | The year is 1934, and Superman has arrived in Metropolis. Features Lex Luthor as the villain protagonist as he comes to grips with the arrival of an alien god. Occasional point-of-view chapters/sections featuring Lois Lane. Takes place outside any established comics continuity. |
| Void Domain | TowerCurator | Complete | Brakket Magical Academy in Northwestern United States is on its last legs. Enrollment of new students is at an all time low. The academy instructors go out to recruit prospective children other magical academies have ignored. Eva is one such recruit. After witnessing her perform magic no teenage mage should have learned, an instructor of the academy offers her a full ride scholarship. Eva does not turn down the opportunity to learn magic in a proper capacity and quickly ships out to Montana. Barely a day there and things already seem off. Every student has the same scholarship, odd-smelling men wander the town, and a spider demon has decided Eva’s dorm room is the place to be. |
| Unsong | Scott Alexander | Complete | Saying a Name of God grants you power, but also alerts UNSONG, who has copyrighted many of them. These Names can be discovered through clever interpretation of theology. |
| Shadows of the Limelight | alexanderwales | Complete | This is a world where fame grants powers. Dominic de Luca was a thief and a liar before entering into the apprenticeship of Welexi Whitespear, the greatest hero of modern times. Now he must navigate the world of the Illustrati, the famous and the infamous, as he tries to secure for himself a place among the gods. |
| Worm | Wildbow | Complete | An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the local ‘cape’ scene’s politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons. |
